# Aseprite-Importer for Unity

This package helps you importing [.ase files](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/docs/ase-file-specs.md) from [aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). The reader is fully written in C# which reads the compressed binary file and creates spritesheets out of it.

## Usage
Import the ```AsepriteImporter``` folder into your project. Now it should import all newly added .ase-files automatically. Already imported assets do need a manual re-import.
